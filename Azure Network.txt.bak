Network Interface:-
The Network Interface is a Hardware device that is used to route the incoming
and outgoing traffic which we receive from the internet.
All the data are passed in the Network Interface.
The private ip address is used for the internal communication between the Network Interfaces.
whereas public ip address is used for the external communication. The public ip address
is assigned by the azure we dont have the control to assign the public ip address.
it is assigned by the azure.
IP Address Overview:-
Let us take a Ip Address as 19.10.118.41
first take 41=41-32=9-8=1
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
0	0	1  1 1 0 0 1	
0	1	1  1 0 1 1 0
0	0   0  0 1 0 1 0
0	0   0  1 0 0 1 1
Attaching the Secondary Interface:-
Public IP address are used to communicate to the internet and private IP address are
used for the communication between the vms.Secondary Network Interface will only have
Private network to communicate to the other machine. This is because for the security
Purpose.
Network Security Group:-
This is used to allow the inbound and outbound traffic rules to access the Vm.
Suppose if we want to access the vm through RDP. we need to add the inbound rule ass 3389 for the
RDP.
If the 3389 is not allowed we will not able to connect the Vm through remotely.
We can attach the network security group either to network interface layer or subnet.
We cannot directly attach the network security group to a VM.
Network Security Group priority:-
It will Check the Priority wise Like Small to Big. It will check form small to big number 
Application Gateway service:-
It is a 7th layer of OSI Layer.
It is used to route the traffict to web application.
It enable ssl/tls termination.
The web application can reside on vm, virtual scale sets,
on premise servers.
Virtual Network Peering Notes
Virtual Network Peering

Virtual Network Peering is used to connect two Azure virtual networks together via the backbone network.

Azure supports connecting two virtual networks located in the same region or networks located across regions.

Once you enable virtual network peering between two virtual networks, the virtual machines can then communicate via their private IP addresses across the peering connection.

You can also peer virtual networks that are located across different subscriptions.

The virtual networks can't have overlapping CIDR blocks.
